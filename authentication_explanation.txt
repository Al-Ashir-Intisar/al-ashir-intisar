Written Explanation for Google OAuth2 Verification

Website Name: ShouldIGo
Developer: Al Ashir Intisar

Why We Need Access to Sensitive and/or Restricted User Data
Our website, ShouldIGo, is a meal decision-making tool designed for students to view cafeteria menus, rate meals, and share their feedback with others. To achieve this functionality, the website requires access to the following sensitive scopes:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email:
This scope is required to retrieve the authenticated user’s email address after they sign in using Google.
The email address is appended to the ratings dataset as a fourth column in the Google Sheet, enabling:
Personalized Identification: Ensures the ability to verify whether the user is part of the intended community or institution. For instance, in this case, the system will validate if the email domain matches our St. Olaf email domain.

How the Website Protects User Data
OAuth2 Security:
The website uses OAuth2 authentication to securely request and access only the necessary permissions.
Users are explicitly informed about the required scopes and their purpose.
Limited Scope Usage:
The website only requests the above-mentioned scope, which is directly tied to its core functionality. No additional or unrelated user data is accessed or collected.

How Users Benefit
Better Decision-Making:
Students can make informed decisions about their meal plans based on peer feedback on cafeteria offerings.
Enhanced Meal Quality:
The insights gathered from meal ratings can later be used to recommend improvements to the cafeteria menu, incorporating student preferences and enhancing the overall dining experience.

Conclusion
The requested scope (userinfo.email) is critical for the website's core functionality. This permission is used strictly to enhance the user experience, ensure data security, and provide transparency and control. We are committed to complying with Google’s data usage policies and respecting user privacy.
